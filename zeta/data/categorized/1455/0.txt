Wars of the RosesTheWars of the Roses, known at the time and for more than a century after asthe Civil Wars, were a series ofcivil warsfought over control of theEnglish thronein the mid-to-late fifteenth century, fought between supporters of two rivalcadet branchesof the royalHouse of Plantagenet:LancasterandYork. The wars extinguished themale linesof the two dynasties, leading to theTudor familyinheriting the Lancastrian claim. Following the war, the Houses of Tudor and York were united, creatinga new royal dynasty, thereby resolving the rival claims.
The conflict had its roots in the wake of theHundred Years' Warand its emergent socio-economic troubles, which weakened the prestige of the English monarchy,[i]unfolding structural problems ofbastard feudalismand the powerful duchies created byEdward III,[8]and the mental infirmity and weak rule ofHenry VI, which revived interest in theYorkist claim to the thronebyRichard of York. Historians disagree over which of these factors were the main catalyst for the wars.
[9]The wars began in 1455 when Richard of York captured Henry at theFirst Battle of St Albansand was appointedLord ProtectorbyParliament, leading to an uneasy peace.
[10]Fighting resumedfour years later. Yorkists, led byWarwick the Kingmaker, captured Henry again at theBattle of Northampton. Richard of York attempted to claim the throne but was dissuaded, and was killed at theBattle of Wakefield. His sonEdward, inherited his claim. The Yorkists lost custody of Henry after theSecond Battle of St Albansbut destroyed the Lancastrian army at theBattle of Towton. Edward was formally crowned three months later in June 1461.
[11][12]Resistance to Edward's rule continued but was crushed at theBattle of Hexham1464, leading to a period of relative peace.
In 1468, Edward marriedElizabeth Woodville, the widow of a Lancastrian knight, and showed favour to her family. He also reversed Warwick's policy of seeking closer ties with France. Warwick was offended and sidelined, and turned against Edward. In 1469, his supporters defeated a Yorkist army at theBattle of Edgcote. He captured and imprisoned Edward shortly afterwards. However, his attempt to replace Edward with his younger brotherGeorge of Clarencemet with no support and Edward was allowed to resume his rule, seemingly reconciled with Warwick. Within a year, Edward accused Warwick and Clarence of fresh treachery and forced them to flee. In France, Warwick joined forces with Margaret of Anjou, and led an invasion of England. When Warwick's younger brotherJohn Nevilledeserted Edward, Edward in turn was forced to flee toFlanders. Warwick restoredHenry VI as king.
Henry's renewed reign was short-lived however. With aid fromBurgundy, Edward mounted a counter-invasion. Henry was returned to prison, and Edward defeated and killed Warwick at theBattle of Barnet. He then defeated a Lancastrian army at theBattle of Tewkesbury. Henry's heir,Edward of Westminsterwas captured and executed. Henry himself died or was assassinated on Edward's order shortly afterwards.
[13]Edward ruled unopposed and England enjoyed a period of relative peace until his death twelve years later in 1483.
Edward's twelve-year-old son reigned for 78 days asEdward Vuntil he was deposed by his uncle,Richard III. Richard assumed the throne under a cloud of controversy, particularly thedisappearance of Edward IV's two sons, sparking ashort-lived but major revoltand triggering a wave of desertions of prominent Yorkists to the Lancastrian cause.
[14]In the midst of the chaos,Henry Tudor, son of Henry VI's half-brother, returned from exile with an army of English, French, andBretontroops. Henry defeated and killed Richard atBosworth Fieldin 1485, assumed the throne as Henry VII, and marriedElizabeth of York, the eldest daughter and sole heir of Edward IV, therebyuniting the rival claims.
TheEarl of Lincolnthen put forwardLambert Simnelas an impostorEdward Plantagenet, a potential claimant to the throne. Lincoln's army was defeated and Lincoln himself killed atStoke Fieldin 1487, ending the wars. Henry never faced any further serious internal military threats to his reign. In 1490,Perkin Warbeckclaimed to beRichard of Shrewsbury, Edward IV's second son and rival claimant to the throne, but was executed before any rebellion could be launched.
[15]TheHouse of TudorruledEnglanduntil 1603. Thereign of the Tudor dynastysaw the strengthening of the prestige and power of the English monarchy, particularly underHenry VIIIandElizabeth I, and the end of themedieval period in Englandwhich subsequently saw the dawn of theEnglish Renaissance.
[1][2][3]HistorianJohn Guyargued that "England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors" than at any time since the Roman occupation.
[16]ContentsNomenclature and symbolism[edit]The name "Wars of the Roses" refers to theheraldic badgesassociated with the two rivalbranchesof theroyal House of Plantagenetfighting for control of the English throne; theWhite Rose of Yorkand theRed Rose of Lancaster. Embryonic forms of this term were used in 1727 byBevil Higgons, who described thequarrel between the two roses.
[17]and byDavid HumeinThe History of England(1754–61):The people, divided in their affections, took different symbols of party: the partisans of the house of Lancaster chose the red rose as their mark of distinction; those of York were denominated from the white; and these civil wars were thus known over Europe by the name of the quarrel between the two roses.
[18]The modern termWars of the Rosescame into common use in the early 19th century following the publication of the 1829 novelAnne of GeiersteinbySir Walter Scott.
[19]Scott based the name on a scene inWilliam Shakespeare's playHenry VI, Part 1(Act 2, Scene 4), set in the gardens of theTemple Church, where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to symbolically display their loyalty to the Lancastrian or Yorkist faction respectively. During Shakespeare's time, the conflict was simply referred to as the "civil wars".
[j]The Yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict, but the red rose of Lancaster was introduced only after the victory ofHenry Tudorat theBattle of Bosworth Fieldin 1485. After Henry's victory and marriage toElizabeth of York, the sole surviving heir ofEdward IV, the two roses were combined to form theTudor rose, to symbolise the union of the two claims.
[20]The use of the rose itself as acognizancestemmed fromEdward I's use of "a golden rose stalked proper".
[21]Often, owing to nobles holding multiple titles, more than one badge was used:Edward IV, for example, used both hissun in splendourasEarl of March, but also his father's falcon andfetterlockasDuke of York. Badges were not always distinct; at theBattle of Barnet, Edward's 'sun' was very similar to theEarl of Oxford'sVere star, which caused fatal confusion in the fighting.
[22]Many participants worelivery badgesassociated with their immediate liege lords or patrons. The wearing of livery was confined to those in "continuous employ of a lord", thus excluding, for example, mercenary companies.
[23]For example, Henry Tudor's forces at Bosworth fought under the banner of ared dragon,[24]while the Yorkist army used Richard III'spersonal deviceof awhite boar.
[25]While the names of the rival houses derive from the cities ofYorkandLancaster, the correspondingduchyanddukedomhad little to do with these cities. The lands and offices attached to theDuchy of Lancasterwere primarily located inGloucestershire,North Wales,Cheshire, and, ironically, inYorkshire, while the estates of theDuke of Yorkwere spread throughout England and Wales, with many in theWelsh Marches.
[26]Origins[edit]Bastard feudalism[edit]Edward III, who ruled England from 1327 to 1377, had five sons who survived into adulthood;Edward of Woodstock "the Black Prince",Lionel of Antwerp,John of Gaunt,Edmund of Langley, andThomas of Woodstock. Throughout his reign, he createdduchiesfor his sons;Cornwallin 1337 for Edward,[27]andClarenceandLancasterin 1362 for Lionel[28]and John[29]respectively. Edmund and Thomas became the dukes ofYork[30]andGloucester[28]respectively in 1385, during the reign ofRichard II. Dukedoms had hitherto never been conferred by any English monarch upon a subject until the creation of theDuchy of Cornwallin 1337,[31]and their genesis spawned a powerful new class of English nobility with claims to thethroneand, theoretically, enough power to vie for it, since the new duchies provided Edward's sons and their heirs presumptive with an income independent of the sovereign or the state,[32]thereby allowing them to establish and maintain their own private military retinues.
[33]Over time, these duchies began to exacerbate the structural defects inherent in so-called "bastard feudalism", a somewhat controversial term coined in 1885 by historianCharles Plummerbut largely defined by Plummer's contemporary,William Stubbs. During the reign of Edward's grandfather,Edward I, Stubbs describes a substantive shift in social dynamics in which the conscription-basedfeudal levycame to be replaced by a system of royal payment in return for military service by themagnateswho served the monarch. Thus, instead ofvassalsrendering military service when called, they paid a portion of their income into their lord's treasury, who would supplement the owed service with hired retainers.
[34]Theseretinueswere known asaffinities; essentially a collection of all the individuals to whom a lord had gathered for service, and came to be one of the most fundamentally defining aspects of bastard feudalism.
[35]These affinities also had the means of tying the more powerful magnates to the lower nobility, although these relationships were now largely defined by personal connections that exhibited reciprocal benefit, rather thantenurialorfeudalrelationships that preceded bastard feudalism.
[36][37]Consequently, lords could now raise retinues they could implicitly trust, since the men of the affinity owed their positions to their patron.
[38][39]These affinities were often much larger than the number of men the lord actually knew, since the members of the affinity also knew and supported each other.
[40]Under the reign ofRichard II, this created a power struggle with the magnates, as Richard sought to increase the size of his own affinities as a counterweight to the growing retinues of his nobles.
[41]The retinues of the magnates became powerful enough to defend the interests of their lord against even the authority of the monarch, as John of Gaunt, and later his son,Henry Bolingbroke, did against Richard.
[33][35]During the wars, disaffected magnates such asRichard of YorkandWarwick the Kingmakerwere able to rely upon their complex network of servants and retainers to successfully defy the authority ofHenry VI.
[42]Succession crisis[edit]The question of succession following the death ofEdward IIIin 1377 is said byMortimerto be the root cause of the Wars of the Roses.
[43]Although Edward's succession seemed secure, there was a "sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent" near the end of his reign;[44]Edward's two eldest sons,Edward, Duke of Cornwall(also known as Edward the Black Prince) and heir presumptive, andLionel, Duke of Clarence, had predeceased their father in 1376 and 1368 respectively. Edward III was survived by three sons with claims to the throne:John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster;Edmund of Langley; andThomas of Woodstock. The Black Prince had a son,Richard, who had a claim to the throne based upon the principle that the son of an elder brother (Edward, in this case) had priority in the line of succession over his uncles. However, as Richard was a minor, had no siblings (on his father's side), and had three living uncles at the time of Edward III's death, there was considerable uncertainty within the realm over who should inherit the throne.
[45]Ultimately, Edward was succeeded by his grandson who was crowned Richard II at just 10 years old.
[46]Under the laws ofprimogeniture, if Richard died without a legitimate heir, his successors would be the descendants of Lionel of Antwerp the Duke of Clarence, Edward III's second eldest son. Clarence's only child, his daughterPhilippa, married into theMortimerfamily and had a son,Roger Mortimer, who technically would have the best legal claim of succession. However, a legal decree issued by Edward III in 1376 introduced complexity into the question of succession, since theletters patenthe issued limited the right of succession to hismale line, which placed his third son, John of Gaunt, ahead of Clarence's descendants, since the latter were descended through thefemale line.
[44]Richard's reign was tumultuous, marked by increasing dissension between the monarch and several of the most powerful nobles.
[47]Richard ruled without a regency council despite his young age in order to exclude his uncle, John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster, from wielding legitimate power.
[48]Unpopular taxes which funded unsuccessful military expeditions in Europe triggered thePeasant's Revoltin 1381,[49]and Parliament's refusal to cooperate with the king's unpopularLord Chancellor,Michael de la Pole, created apolitical crisisthat seriously threatened to dethrone Richard.
[50]Richard had repeatedly switched his choice of heir throughout his reign to keep his political enemies at bay.
[51]In France, much of the territory conquered by Edward III had been lost,[52]leading Richard tonegotiate a peacewithCharles VI. The peace proposal, which would effectively have made England a client kingdom of France, was derided and rejected by Parliament, which was predominately controlled by the knights fighting the war.
[53]Richard decided to negotiate ade factopeace directly with Charles without seeking Parliament's approval and agreed to marry his six-year-old daughter,Isabella of Valois. Richard used the interim peace to punish his political rivals; when John of Gaunt died in 1399, Richard exiled Gaunt's sonHenry Bolingbroketo France, and confiscated hislands and titles.
[54]In May 1399, Richard left England for a military expedition in Ireland,[55]giving Bolingbroke the opportunity to return to England.
[56]With the support of much of the disaffected nobility, Richard was deposed and Bolingbroke crowned as Henry IV, the first Lancastrian monarch.
[57]Lancastrian claim[edit]TheHouse of Lancasterdescended from John of Gaunt, the third surviving son of Edward III. The name derives from Gaunt's primary title as Duke of Lancaster, which he heldby right of his spouse,Blanche of Lancaster. The Lancastrian claim on the throne had received preference from Edward III which explicitly emphasised themaleline of descent.
[44]Henry IV based his right to depose Richard II and subsequent assumption of the throne upon this claim,[58]since it could be argued that the heir presumptive was in factEdmund Mortimer, the great-grandson of Edward III's second surviving son,Lionel, Duke of Clarence.
[59]However, Mortimer was descended through thefemaleline, inheriting the claim from his grandmother,Philippa.
[44]An important branch of the House of Lancaster was theHouse of Beaufort, whose members were descended from Gaunt by his mistress,Katherine Swynford. Originally illegitimate, they were legitimised by an Act of Parliament when Gaunt and Katherine later married. However, Henry IV excluded them from the line of succession to the throne.
[60]Yorkist claim[edit]TheHouse of Yorkdescended from Edmund of Langley, the fourth surviving son of Edward III and younger brother of John of Gaunt. The name derives from Langley's primary title as Duke of York, which he acquired in 1385 during the reign of his nephew, Richard II.
[61]The Yorkist claim on the throne, unlike the Lancastrian claim, was based upon thefemaleline of descent, as descendants of Lionel, the Duke of Clarence. Langley's second son,Richard of Conisburgh, had marriedAnne de Mortimer, daughter ofRoger Mortimerand sister ofEdmund Mortimer. Anne's grandmother,Philippa of Clarence, was the daughter of Lionel of Antwerp. During the fourteenth century, the Mortimers were the most powerfulmarcherfamily in the kingdom.
[62]G.M. Trevelyan wrote that "the Wars of the Roses were to a large extent a quarrel between WelshMarcher Lords, who were also great English nobles, closely related to the English throne."[63]Lancastrian dynasty[edit]Almost immediately after assuming the throne, Henry IV facedan attempted depositionin 1400 by theEarl of Salisbury, theDuke of Exeter, theDuke of Surrey, and theBaron Despenserto re-install the imprisoned Richard as king. The attempt failed, all four conspirators were executed, and Richard died shortly thereafter "by means unknown" inPontefract Castle.
[64]Further west inWales, the Welsh had generally supported Richard's rule, and, welded to a myriad of other socio-economic problems, the accession of Henry triggered amajor rebellion in Walesled byOwain Glyndŵr, a member of the Welsh nobility.
[65]Glyndŵr's rebellion would outlast Henry's reign, and would not end until 1415.
[65]During the revolt, Glyndŵr received aid from members of theTudurs, a prominent Anglesey family and maternal cousins of Glyndŵr himself, who would come to play a defining role in the coming Wars of the Roses.
[66]Disputes over promises of land, money, and royal favour in exchange for their continued support drove theHouse of Percy, led by theEarl of Northumberlandand theEarl of Worcester, to rebel multiple times against Henry. The first challenge was defeated atShrewsburyin 1403 and Worcester was executed,[67]while a second attempt failed atBramham Moorin 1408, at which Northumberland was killed.
[68]Henry himself died in 1413, and was succeeded by his son,Henry of Monmouth, who was crowned Henry V.
[69]While not plagued by constant rebellions as his father's reign was, Henry V faced a major challenge to his authority in the form of theSouthampton Plot, led bySir Thomas Grey,Henry, Baron Scrope, andRichard of Conisburgh, the latter of whom was the second son of Edmund of Langley the 1st Duke of York, in favour of the youngEdmund Mortimer, who at one time was the heir presumptive to Richard II, and a great-great-grandson of Edward III.
[70]Mortimer remained loyal and informed Henry of the plot, who had all three ringleaders executed.
[71]To cement his position as king both domestically and abroad, Henry revivedold dynastic claims to the French throne, and, using commercial disputes and the support France loaned to Owain Glyndŵr as acasus belli,invaded France in 1415.
[72]Henrycaptured Harfleuron 22 September[73]and inflicted a decisive defeat on the French atAgincourton 25 October which wiped out a significant part of the French nobility.
[74]The English dead included theDuke of York, the elder brother ofRichard of Conisburgh, who had attempted to usurp Henry.
[75]Agincourt and Henry's subsequent campaigns firmly entrenched the legitimacy of theLancastrian monarchyand Henry's pursuit of his claims on the French throne.
[76]In 1420, Henry andCharles VI of Francesigned theTreaty of Troyes. The treaty disinherited the French DauphinCharlesfrom the line of succession, married Charles' daughterCatherine of Valoisto Henry, and acknowledged their future sons as legitimate successors to the French throne.
[77]York had died at Agincourt with no issue, so Henry permittedRichard of Yorkto inherit the title and lands of his uncle through his father, Richard of Conisburgh, York's younger brother. Henry, who himself had three younger brothers and had recently married Catherine, likely did not doubt that the Lancastrian claim on the crown was secure.
[62]On 6 December 1421, Catherine gave birth to a son,Henry. The following year on 31 August, Henry V died ofdysenteryat the age of 36, and his son ascended to the throne at just nine months old.
[78]Henry V's younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate heirs, leaving only the Beaufort family as alternative Lancastrian successors. As Richard of York grew into maturity and Henry VI's rule deteriorated, York's claim to the throne became more attractive. The revenue from his estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the kingdom.
[26]Reign of Henry VI[edit]From early childhood,Henry VIwas surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors. His younger surviving paternal uncle,Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, sought to be namedLord Protectoruntil Henry came of age, and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends,[79]but was opposed by his half-uncle,Henry Beaufort. On several occasions, Beaufort called onJohn, Duke of Bedford, Gloucester's older brother and nominalregentto Henry, to return from his post as the king's commander in France, either to mediate or defend him against Gloucester's accusations of treason.
[80]Overseas, the French had rallied aroundJoan of Arcand had inflicted major defeats on the English atOrléans,[81]andPatay,[82]reversing many of the gains made by Henry V and leading to the coronation of the Dauphin asCharles VIIinReimson 17 July 1429.
[83]Henry was formally crowned as Henry VI, aged 7, shortly thereafter on 6 November in response to the coronation of Charles.
[84]Around this time, Henry's mother Catherine of Valois had remarried toOwen Tudor[85]and bore two surviving sons;Edmund TudorandJasper Tudor, both of whom would play key roles in the concluding stages of the coming wars.
[86]Henry came of age in 1437 at age sixteen.
[87]However, Bedford had died two years earlier in 1435, and Beaufort largely withdrew himself from public affairs sometime thereafter, in part because of the rise to prominence of his allyWilliam de la Pole, Earl of Suffolkas the dominant personality in the royal court.
[88]Like Beaufort, Suffolk favoured a diplomatic rather than a military solution to the deteriorating situation in France, a position which resonated with Henry, who was by nature averse to violence and bloodshed.
[89][90]Suffolk was opposed by Gloucester and the risingRichard of York, both of whom favoured a continued prosecution of a military solution against France. Suffolk and the Beaufort family frequently received large grants of money, land, and important government and military positions from the king, who preferred their lesshawkishinclinations, redirecting much-needed resources away from Richard and Gloucester's campaigns in France, leading to Richard developing a bitter resentment for the Beauforts.
[91]Suffolk continued to increase his influence at court as the principal architect of theTreaty of Toursin 1444 to broker peace between England and France. Suffolk successfully negotiated the marriage to Henry ofMargaret of Anjou, only a distant relation of Charles VII through marriage rather than blood, in exchange for the strategically important lands ofMaineandAnjou.
[89][92]Though Suffolk earned a promotion from Earl to Marquess (and would be made a Duke in 1448) for his efforts, the clauses of the treaty that required cession of lands to France were kept secret from the English public due to fears of a significant backlash, but Henry insisted on the treaty.
[92]Two years later in 1447, Suffolk succeeded in having Gloucester arrested for treason. Gloucester died while awaiting trial, with some at the time suspecting that Suffolk had him poisoned.
[93][94]Richard of York was stripped of his prestigious command in France and sent to govern the relatively distantLordship of Irelandwith a ten-year term of office, where he could not interfere with affairs at court.
[95]During this time, England continued to suffer reversals in France. Suffolk, who was now the principalpower behind the throne, could not avoid taking the blame for these losses. Additionally, the blame of the unfavourable request to cede Maine and Anjou to the French was laid at Suffolk's feet, though he continued to insist he made no promises during negotiations to such a demand.
[96]In 1450, Suffolk was arrested, imprisoned in theTower of London, and impeached in the Commons. Henry intervened and instead exiled Suffolk for five years, but en route to Calais, Suffolk was captured and executed on 2 May 1450.
[97][98]Suffolk was succeeded byEdmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, nephew of Henry Beaufort, as the leader of the faction pursuing peace with France, who had been appointed as Richard's replacement as commander in France in 1448. Somerset's political position was somewhat fragile, as English military failures in 1449 following a resumption of hostilities left him vulnerable to criticism from Richard's allies at court.
[98]Somerset had by this time become a close ally of Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou.
[99]Margaret herself wielded almost complete control over the pliable king Henry,[100]and her close friendship with Somerset led many to suspect the two were having an affair; indeed, upon the birth of Henry and Margaret's son,Edward of Westminsterin 1453, there were widespread rumours that Somerset was the father.
[101]On 15 April 1450, the English suffered a major reversal in France atFormigny, which paved the way for the French reconquest ofNormandy.
[102]That same year, there was aviolent popular uprisingin Kent, which is often seen as a precursor to the Wars of the Roses.
[103]The rebel manifesto,The Complaint of the Poor Commons of Kent, written under the stewardship of rebel leader Jack Cade, accused the crown of extortion, perversion of justice, and election fraud. The rebels occupied parts of London, and executedJames Fiennes, the unpopularLord High Treasurer.
[104]They dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several ringleaders, including Cade, were later executed.
[105]After the rebellion, the grievances of Cade and his followers formed the basis of Richard of York's opposition to a royal government from which he felt unduly excluded.
[103]Richard used the opportunity to return from Ireland and went to London. Angling himself as a reformer to demand better government, he was eventually imprisoned for much of 1452 and 1453.
[106]By the summer of the latter year, Richard seemed to have lost the power struggle.
[107]Throughout these quarrels, Henry himself had taken little part in proceedings. He displayed several symptoms of mental illness, possibly inherited from his maternal grandfather,Charles VI of France.
[108]His near-total lack of leadership in military matters had left the English forces in France scattered and weak, which left them ripe for defeat at Formigny in 1450.
[109]Henry was described as more interested in matters of religion and learning, which, coupled with his timid and passive nature and, if not well-intentioned, aversion to warfare, made him an ineffectual king for the time.
[110]On 17 July 1453, the English forces in southern France suffered a catastrophic defeat atCastillon, and England lost all her possessions in France except for thePale of Calais, shifting the balance of power in Europe, and ending theHundred Years' War.
[111]Perhaps in reaction to the news, Henry suffered a complete mental breakdown, during which he failed to recognise his newborn son, Edward.
[112]On 22 March 1454, CardinalJohn Kemp, theLord Chancellor, died, and Henry could not be induced to nominate a successor, thus making government in the king's name constitutionally impossible.
[113]The lack of central authority led to a continued deterioration of the unstable political situation, which polarised around long-standing feuds between the more powerful noble families, in particular thePercy-Neville feud, and theBonville-Courtenay feud, creating a volatile political climate ripe for civil war.
[114]To ensure the country could be governed, a Regency Council was established and, despite the protests of Margaret, was led by Richard of York, who was appointedLord Protectorand Chief Councillor on 27 March 1454. Richard appointed his brother-in-law,Richard Neville, Earl of Salisburyto the post of Chancellor, backing the Nevilles against their chief adversary,Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. In backing the Nevilles, Richard gained a key ally, Salisbury's son theEarl of Warwick, one of the wealthiest and most powerful magnates in the kingdom. Richard removed Somerset from his position and imprisoned him in the Tower of London.
[115]In 1455, Henry made a surprise recovery from his mental instability, and reversed much of Richard's progress. Somerset was released and restored to favour, and Richard was forced out of court into exile.
[116]However, disaffected nobles, chiefly theEarl of Warwickand his father theEarl of Salisbury, backed the claims of the rivalHouse of Yorkto control of the government.
[117]Henry, Somerset, and a select council of nobles elected to hold a Great Council atLeicesteron 22 May, away from Somerset's enemies in London. Fearing that charges of treason would be brought against them, Richard and his allies gathered an army to intercept the royal party atSt Albans, before they could reach the Council.
[118]York's Revolt (1455–1460)[edit]St. Albans[edit]Richardled a force of around 3,000–7,000 troops south toward London, where they were met by Henry's force of 2,000 atSt Albans, north of London, on 22 May 1455.
[119]Though theensuing struggleresulted in fewer than 160 casualties combined,[120][121]it was a decisive Yorkist victory.
[120]KingHenry VIhad been taken prisoner by Richard's men, having found the monarch hiding in a localtanner's shop, abandoned by his courtiers and advisors.
[122]Despite the paucity of casualties on either side, many of Richard and the Neville family's most influential foes were killed, including theDuke of Somerset, theEarl of Northumberland, and theBaron Clifford.
[120]With the king in his custody and many of his key rivals dead, Richard was again appointedLord ProtectorbyParliament, and the Yorkist faction regained their position of influence.
[10]Richard's allies were soon in ascendancy thanks to the temporarily stabilised situation, particularly the youngEarl of Warwick, who, in his capacity asCaptain of Calais, had conducted anti-piracy operations in theEnglish Channel.
[123]Warwick rapidly overtook his father, theEarl of Salisbury, as Richard's key ally, protecting Richard from retribution in Parliament.
[124]Warwick's position as commander of the strategically-important port ofCalaisalso gave him command of England's largeststanding army.
[125]Henry's consort,Margaret of Anjou, considered Warwick a serious threat to the throne and attempted to cut off his supplies,[126]however a French attack onSandwichin August 1457 ignited fears of a French invasion, forcing Margaret to concede and provide Warwick with the funding he required to protect the realm.
[127]However, in February 1456, Henry recovered his mental faculties, and once again relieved Richard of his office as Lord Protector, reassuming personal governance over the realm.
[128][129]Despite the tenuous peace, disorder was returning to the kingdom as sporadic fighting once more broke out between theNevilleandPercyfamilies.
[130]To quell the growing discontent, Henry attempted to broker apublic display of reconciliationbetween the two sides atSt. Paul's Cathedralon 25 March 1458, however, no sooner had the procession dispersed than the plotting resumed.
[130]Act of Accord[edit]Meanwhile, as Henry attempted in vain to secure peace in England, Warwick, in disregard of royal authority, had conducted attacks against theCastilianfleet in May 1458, and against a fleet of theHanseatic Leaguea few weeks later.
[131]His position in Calais also enabled him to establish relations withCharles VII of France, andPhilip the GoodofBurgundy, international connections that would serve him in the future.
[132]In response to the attacks, Warwick was summoned to London to face inquiries along with Richard and Salisbury. However, fearing arrest once they were isolated from their allies, they refused.
[133][134]Richard instead summoned the Nevilles to rendezvous at his stronghold ofLudlow Castlein theWelsh Marches; Warwick departed Calais with a portion of the garrison there to join the main Yorkist forces.
[135]Margaret had not been idle during this time and had been actively recruiting armed support for Henry, distributing a livery emblem of a silver swan to knights and squires enlisted by her personally.
[136]Before Warwick could join them, the Yorkist army of 5,000 troops under Salisbury was ambushed by a Lancastrian force twice their size under theBaron AudleyatBlore Heathon 23 September 1459.
[137][138]The Lancastrian army was defeated,[139]and Baron Audley himself killed in the fighting.
[138]In September, Warwick crossed over into England and made his way north to Ludlow.
[140]At nearbyLudford Bridge, the Yorkist forces were scattered due to the defection of Warwick's Calais troops underSir Andrew Trollope.
[141]Forced to flee, Richard, who was still Lieutenant of Ireland, left forDublinwith his second son, theEarl of Rutland, while Warwick and Salisbury sailed to Calais accompanied by Richard's heir, theEarl of March.
[142]The Lancastrian faction appointed the newDuke of Somersetto replace Warwick in Calais, however, the Yorkists managed to retain the loyalty of the garrison.
[143]Fresh from their victory at Ludford Bridge, the Lancastrian factionassembled a ParliamentatCoventrywith the sole purpose ofattaintingRichard, his sons, Salisbury, and Warwick,[144]however, the actions of this assembly caused many uncommitted lords to fear for their titles and property.
[145]In March 1460, Warwick sailed to Ireland under the protection of the GasconLord of Duras[146]to concert plans with Richard, evading the royal fleet commanded by theDuke of Exeter,[147]before they returned to Calais.
[148]In late June 1460, Warwick, Salisbury, and Edward of March crossed the Channel and rode north to London, where they enjoyed widespread support.
[149]Salisbury was left with a force tobesiege the Tower of London,[150]while Warwick and March pursued Henry northward.
[151]The Yorkists caught up with the Lancastrians and defeated them atNorthamptonon 10 July 1460.
[152]TheDuke of Buckingham, theEarl of Shrewsbury, theViscount Beaumont, and theBaron Egremontwere all killed defending their king.
[153]For a second time, Henry was taken prisoner by the Yorkists, who escorted him to London, compelling the surrender of the Tower garrison.
[154]That September, Richard returned from Ireland, and, at the Parliament of October that year, he made a symbolic gesture of his intention to claim the English crown by placing his hand upon the throne,[155]an act which shocked the assembly.
[156]Even Richard's closest allies were not prepared to support such a move.
[157]Assessing Richard's claim, the judges felt thatCommon lawprinciples could not determine who had priority in the succession, and declared the matter "above the law and passed their learning".
[158]Finding a lack of decisive support for his claim among the nobility who at this stage had no desire to usurp Henry, a compromise was reached: theAct of Accordwas passed on 25 October 1460, which stated that following Henry's death, his sonEdwardwould be disinherited, and the throne would pass to Richard.
[159]However, the compromise was quickly found to be unpalatable, and hostilities resumed.
[160]Death of Richard of York[edit]Queen Margaret and her son had fled to Lancastrian-heldHarlech Castle, where they joined Henry's half-brotherJasper Tudorand theDuke of Exeter, who were recruiting troops in Wales and theWest Country. Margaret headed north to Scotland, where she successfully negotiated the use ofScottishtroops and other aid for the Lancastrian cause from Queen RegentMary of Guelders, in return for the surrender ofBerwickwhich a year prior,James II of Scotland, using the turmoil of the war as an opportunity tried to retake the town as well asRoxburgh. The latter, though successful, cost him his life. A similar successful negotiation was made for the use ofFrenchtroops and aid for the Lancastrians cause that same year, this time in return for the surrender ofJersey.
[161]Lancastrians were also rallying in theNorth of England, where the Percy family were gathering support. They were joined by Somerset and theEarl of Devon.
[162][163]Richard, his son the Earl of Rutland, and Salisbury left London to contain the Lancastrian threat in the north.
[164]On 16 December 1460, Richard's vanguardclashed with Somerset's forcesfrom the West Country, and was defeated.
[165]On 21 December, Richard reached his fortress ofSandal Castlenear the town ofWakefield, with the Lancastrians encamped just 9 miles (14 km) to the east. For reasons unclear, Richard sortied from the castle on 30 December,[166]andin the ensuing battle, Richard, his son the Earl of Rutland, and Warwick's younger brotherSir Thomas Nevillewere all killed.
[167][161]Ascension and reign of Edward IV (1461–1483)[edit]Edward claims the throne[edit]Following the Yorkist defeat atWakefield, Richard's 18-year-old son,Edward, Earl of Marchwas now heir to theDukedom of York, and thereby inherited Richard's claim to the throne.
[168]Edward sought to prevent the Lancastrian armies gathering under theTudorsin western England and Wales from joining the main Lancastrian forces opposing him in the north. On 2 February 1461, he decisively defeated the Lancastrian armies atMortimer's Cross,[169]and the capturedSir Owen Tudor, husband toHenry V'swidowCatherine of Valois, was executed by his troops.
[170]As dawn broke across the field, a meteorological phenomenon known asparhelionoccurred, giving the appearance of a trio of suns rising. Edward calmed his frightened troops by convincing them it represented theHoly Trinity, and therefore evidence of divine blessing upon their cause.
[171]Edward would later take the heraldic symbol of thesunne in splendouras hispersonal device.
[172][173]In the north, having defeated and killed Richard, Margaret's troops and the victorious Lancastrians moved south,[174]while Warwick, with the captive Henry in tow, moved his forces to meet them astride the ancient Roman road ofWatling StreetatSt Albans. Warwick's forces were well-entrenched,[175]but were ultimatelydefeated by Margaret's troopson 17 February.
[176]Henry was recaptured by the Lancastrians, and knighted his young sonEdward of Westminster, who in turn knighted thirty Lancastrian leaders.
[163]Warwick and his troops marched to rendezvous with the Yorkist troops in the Marches under Edward, fresh from their victory at Mortimer's Cross.
[177]Although the Lancastrians had the strategic advantage after St Albans, the Lancastrian cause was unpopular in London, and the citizenry refused entry to Margaret's troops. Warwick and Edward, seizing the initiative, marched rapidly to London, where Edward was proclaimedEdward IV of Englandby a hastily gathered assembly.
[178][179]Edward was a more attractive prospect as a monarch for the people of England; contemporaries such asPhilippe de Comminesdescribe him as energetic, handsome, affable,[180]and struck an imposing sight in full armour and resplendent clothing, a deliberate move on the part of his supporters to contrast him with Henry, whose physical and mental frailties had fatally undermined his support.
[181]To cement his position, Edward and Warwick moved north to confront the Lancastrians. Warwick, leading the Yorkist vanguard, inconclusively clashed with the Lancastrians atFerrybridgeon 28 March, at which Warwick was wounded,[182]and the Lancastrian commanders, theBaronsClifford, andNeville(a distant relative of Warwick), were killed.
[183][184]Edward engaged the Lancastrian's main army the following day on 29 March nearTowton,Yorkshire. Thebattle that followedwas the largest and bloodiest ever fought on English soil,[185]and resulted in a decisive triumph for Edward which broke the power of the Lancastrians in the north.
[11]The lynchpins of Lancastrian control in the royal court were either killed or fled the country; theEarl of Northumberlandwas killed,[186]Sir Andrew Trollope, one of the most astute Lancastrian field commanders,[187]was also killed,[188]while theEarl of Wiltshirewas captured and executed.
[189]Henry, Margaret, and their son Prince Edward fled north toScotland.
[190]Edward returned to London for hiscoronation,[191]while Warwick remained in the north to pacify further Lancastrian resistance.
[192]Towton confirmed to the English people that Edward was the uncontested ruler of England, at least for the time being,[11][12]and used the opportunity to attaint 14 Lancastrian peers and 96 knights and minor members of thegentry.
[193][194]Coronation of Edward IV and Warwick's apex[edit]Edward was formally crownedKing of Englandon 28 June 1461 inWestminster Abbey.
[195]Edward sought towin the affectionsof his vanquished foes; he pardoned many of the Lancastrians he attainted following his victory at Towton after they submitted to his rule,[196]and permitted them to retain their property and titles.
[193]For his part, Warwick benefited generously from Edward's patronage, and became the most powerful noble in the country.
[197]He had inherited the lands and titles of both his parents,[198]and was made High Admiral of England, Steward of theDuchy of Lancaster, along with several other offices of importance.
[199]In the summer of 1462, Warwick successfully negotiated a truce with Scotland,[126]while atPiltowninIreland, Yorkist forces under theEarl of Desmonddecisively defeated the Lancastrians under theEarl of Ormond,[200]forcing the Ormonds into exile and ending Lancastrian designs on Ireland.
[201]That October, Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France, and captured the castles ofAlnwickandBamburgh,[202]although they were back in Yorkist hands within just three months.
[203]In the spring of 1463, the north of England rose in revolt in support of Henry whenSir Ralph Percylaid siege toNorham Castle.
[204]Separate truces had been agreed with bothScotlandandFranceby late 1463, allowing Warwick to recover much of the territory lost in the north by 1464.
[205]The main Lancastrian army moved south through Northumberland, however, it was destroyed by a Yorkist force underJohn NevilleatHexhamon 15 May 1464.
[206]All three Lancastrian commanders, theDuke of Somerset,[207]theBaron Ros,[208]and theBaron Hungerford,[209]were all captured and executed. Yorkist troops captured the deposed king Henry in the woods near theRiver Ribble,[210]and was taken to London where he was imprisoned in the Tower.
[211][212]With Somerset's army defeated and Henry captured, all effective resistance to Edward's rule had been wiped out.
[213]Edward saw no profit in killing Henry while his son remained alive, instead preferring to keep the Lancastrian claim with a frail captive.
[214]Margaret and Prince Edward were compelled to leave Scotland and sailed for the court of Margaret's cousin,Louis XI of France, where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for many years.
[215]Growing discontent[edit]With his position upon the throne secure, Edward was free to pursue his domestic and foreign ambitions. Internationally, Edward favoured astrategic alliancewith theDuchy of Burgundy, however, Warwick persuaded him to negotiate a treaty withLouis XI of France; at the negotiations, Warwick suggested Edward would be disposed to amarriage alliancewith the French crown; the intended bride either being Louis' sister-in-lawBona of Savoy, or his daughter,Anne of France.
[216]To his considerable embarrassment and rage, Warwick discovered in October 1464 that four months earlier on 1 May, Edward had secretly marriedElizabeth Woodville, the widow of a Lancastrian noble.
[217]Elizabeth had 12 siblings, some of whom married into prominent families, turning the Woodvilles into a powerful political establishment independent of Warwick's control.
[218]The move demonstrated that Warwick was not thepower behind the throneas many had assumed,[219]and the marriage was criticised by Edward's ownPrivy Councillors, who felt that marriage to a woman who was the daughter of neither a duke nor an earl was unbefitting a man of royal blood.
[220]Warwick attempted to restore his lost influence by accusing Elizabeth, and her motherJacquetta of Luxembourg, of witchcraft,[221]a ploy which, while unsuccessful, did not break the relationship between Warwick and Edward.
[222]Edward's choice of bride would plague him politically for the rest of his reign.
[223]Politically, it opened Edward up to accusations that Warwick had been intentionally deceiving the French into believing the king was committed to the marriage proposal.
[224]Meanwhile, Elizabeth's family began to ascend to positions of great importance; Edward's father-in-law, theEarl Rivers, was appointed asLord High Treasurer, and supported the king's position for a Burgundian alliance.
[225]Unbeknownst to Warwick, Edward had already concluded a treaty in secret with Burgundy in October 1466, while leaving Warwick to continue with doomed negotiations with the French court.
[226]In 1467, Edward removed Warwick's brother, theArchbishop of York, from his office ofLord Chancellor, while the king refused to entertain a marriage proposal between Warwick's eldest daughter,Isabel, and Edward's brother, theDuke of Clarence.
[227]For various reasons, Clarence himself greatly resented his brother's interference.
[227]In 1468, Edward sent his forces and successfully retookJerseyfrom the French.
Redesdale's rebellion[edit]In April 1469, a rebellion broke out inYorkshireunder a leader known only asRobin of Redesdale.
[228]A second pro-Lancastrian revolt broke out the following month, which demanded the restoration ofHenry PercyasEarl of Northumberland,[229]however the revolt was quickly crushed by the current earl,John Neville, though he made little attempt to quell Redesdale's actions.
[229]Warwick and Clarence had spent the summer assembling troops, officially to suppress the revolt, however, in early July they travelled toCalais, where Clarence and Isabel were married in a ceremony overseen by Warwick. They returned to London, where they assembled their troops, ostensibly to remove 'evil councillors' from the king's company and re-establish good governance and moved north to link with the Yorkshire rebels.
[230]Privately, Warwick hoped to depose Edward and install the nineteen-year-old Clarence on the throne.
[231]Redesdale defeated royal troops atEdgcoteon 26 July 1469; although Redesdale was reportedly killed, the two royal commanders, theEarl of Pembrokeand theEarl of Devonwere both captured and executed.
[232]Edward's father-in-law, Earl Rivers, and the earl's son,Sir John Woodville, were apprehended and murdered.
[233]After the battle, Edward was taken captive by George Neville and held atMiddleham Castle.
[234][235]However, it soon became clear to the rebels that neither Warwick nor Clarence enjoyed significant support, and unable to quell the growing disorder, Edward was released in September of that year and reassumed his duties as king.
[236]In March 1470, Warwick and Clarence exploited political instabilities toinduce Lincolnshire into a full-scale revolt, hoping to lure Edward north where he could be taken by Warwick's men.
[k]However, on 12 March 1470, Edward routed the Yorkist rebels atLosecoat Fieldand captured the rebel leader, theBaron Willoughby, who named Warwick and Clarence as the "partners and chief provokers" of the rebellion.
[238]Physical evidence also came to light which proved the complicity of the two men, who subsequently fled to France in May.
[239]Willoughby was beheaded, and his lands seized.
[240]Warwick's Rebellion and death of Henry VI[edit]Seeking to capitalise on Warwick's disfavour with the king,Louis XI of Francearranged a reconciliation between Warwick and his bitter rival, Margaret of Anjou, with the objective to restore Henry to the throne.
[241]As part of the arrangement, Warwick agreed to marry his daughter Anne to Edward of Westminster, Margaret and Henry's son and heir apparent;[242]while the marriage was solemnised, it may not have been consummated, as Margaret was hoping to find a better match for her son once he became king.
[243]Staging a diversionary uprising in the north, Warwick and Clarence launched a two-pronged invasion of England atDartmouthandPlymouthon 13 September 1470.
[244]Warwick's brother, theMarquess of Montagujoined him, bitter with the king that his support for the crown during the preceding revolts did not result in the restoration of his earldom.
[245]Edward rushed south to meet the invasion, while Montagu's forces advanced from the north, and the king found himself surrounded.
[246]With few options, Edward, his younger brotherRichard, Duke of Gloucester, and several hundred retainers fled toFlanderson 2 October, then part of theDuchy of Burgundy, his ally.
[l]Henry wasrestored to the throne, a throne which Warwick was now indisputably in effective control of.
[249]In November, Edward was attainted, and his brother Clarence was awarded the title ofDuke of York.
[250]Burgundy was ruled byCharles the Bold, husband of Edward's sister Margaret. Charles rendered precious little assistance to his brother-in-law, something Edward would never forget.
[251]However, unfortunately for Warwick and Clarence, Henry's new regime was precariously unstable; theDuke of Somersetheld Warwick responsible forhis father'sdeath in 1455, and the ensuing internal disputes eventually left Warwick and Clarence politically isolated.
[252]With the backing of Flemish merchants, Edward landed atRavenspurnin Yorkshire on 14 March 1471, supported by theEarl of Northumberland.
[253]Edward was joined by troops underSir William ParrandSir James Harrington, a move which convinced Clarence, who was politically disadvantaged by his agreement with the Lancastrians,[254]to abandon Warwick and Henry and join his brother.
[255]Edward's army made rapidly for London, where they took the by now feeble king Henry prisoner and sent him to theTower of London.
[256]Poor weather contained French troops under Margaret and Edward of Westminster on the continent, preventing Warwick from being reinforced.
[257]Despite this and Clarence's defection, Warwick marched in pursuit of Edward's growing army, and the two sides met in battle atBarneton 14 April 1471.
[258]Poor visibility due to thick mist and the similarity of Edward'sheraldic sunto the Earl of Oxford'sstar[259]led to the Lancastrians attacking their own men,[260]and, coupled with Edward's determined attack, Warwick's army was destroyed. During the rout, Warwick was unhorsed and killed,[261]along with his brother theMarquess of Montagu,[262]while theDuke of Exeterwas apprehended and imprisoned in theTower of London.
[263]In 1475, Exeter would be sent on a Yorkist expedition to France, where he was reputed to have fallen overboard while at sea, and drowned without any witnesses.
[264]Warwick's defeat and death was a catastrophic blow for the Lancastrian cause,[265]and the Neville family's political influence was irrevocably broken.
[266]Tewkesbury campaign[edit]Though the Nevilles had been defeated, on the same day of the clash at Barnet, Margaret had managed to land her forces atWeymouth, and augmented her army with recruits from theWelsh Marches.
[267]Despite the heavy defeat they had suffered at Barnet, survivors from the battle rallied around the Lancastrian queen.
[265]Edward moved to intercept the Lancastrian army, realising they are attempting to cross theRiver Severninto Wales. Acting upon correspondence sent by the king,Sir Richard Beauchamp, governor ofGloucester, barred the gates to Margaret's troops, preventing the Lancastrians from crossing in time.
[268]On 4 May 1471, Edward intercepted and engaged Margaret's army atTewkesbury, defeating it. Henry and Margaret's son,Edward of Westminster, was killed by Clarence's men,[269]while theDuke of Somerset[269]and theEarl of Devon[270]were both killed. On 21 May 1471,Henry VIdied. A contemporary chronicle (favourable to Edward IV) reported Henry's death as caused by "melancholy" after hearing of his son's death.
[271]It is widely suspected however, that with Henry's only heir dead, Edward had ordered the formerking's murder.
[13]Margaret of Anjou was imprisoned until she was ransomed by Louis XI in 1475 to France,[272]where she would live for the remainder of her life, dying on 25 August 1482.
[273]Reign of Edward IV[edit]With the defeats at Barnet and Tewkesbury, armed Lancastrian resistance appeared to be at an end. However, Edward's regime was progressively fractured by a worsening feud between his brothers, theDuke of Clarenceand theDuke of Gloucester. On 22 December 1476, Clarence's wifeIsabeldied. Clarence accused one of the late Isabel'sladies-in-waiting, Ankarette Twynyho, of having murdered her, and, in turn, Clarencemurderedher. Ankarette's grandson received a retrospective pardon for Ankarette from Edward in 1478, illustrating the quasi-monarchical attitude of Clarence which Edward was growing wary of.
[274]In 1477, Clarence was proposed as a suitor forMary, who had just becomeDuchess of Burgundy, but Edward objected to the match, and Clarence left the royal court.
[275]For his part, Gloucester was married toAnne Neville; both Anne and Isabel were daughters of theCountess of Warwick, and therefore heirs to their mother's considerable fortune.
[276]Many of the estates held by the two brothers had been bestowed upon them by Edward's patronage (who retained the right to revoke them). This was not the case with property acquired through marriage; this difference fuelled the disagreement.
[277]Clarence continued to fall out of favour with Edward; persistently widespread claims he was involved in a revolt against Edward led to his imprisonment and execution at theTower of Londonon 18 February 1478.
[278]Edward's reign was relatively peaceful domestically; in 1475 he invaded France, however he signed theTreaty of Picquigny[279]with Louis XI whereby Edward withdrew after receiving an initial payment of 75,000crownsplus an annual pension of 50,000 crowns,[280]while in 1482, he attempted to usurp the Scottish throne but was ultimately compelled to withdraw back to England. Nevertheless, they were successful in retakingBerwick.
[281]In 1483, Edward's health began to fail and he fell fatally ill that Easter. Prior to his death, he named his brother Richard to act as Lord Protector for his twelve-year-old son and successor,Edward. On 9 April 1483, Edward IV died.
[282]Richard III and Tudor conquest (1483–1487)[edit]Reign of Richard III[edit]During Edward's reign, his brotherRichard, Duke of Gloucesterhad risen to become the most powerful magnate in the north of England,[283]particularly in the city ofYorkwhere his popularity was high.
[283]Prior to his death, the king had named Richard asLord Protectorto act asregentto his twelve-year-old son,Edward.
[282]Richard's allies, particularlyHenry Stafford, Duke of Buckinghamand the powerful and wealthy BaronWilliam Hastings, theLord Chamberlain, urged Richard to bring a strong force to London to counter any move the Woodville family might make.
[284]Richard departed Yorkshire for London, where he intended to meet the young king atNorthamptonand travel to London together.
[285]Following Edward's death, theDowager QueenElizabethinstructed her brother,Anthony Woodville, Earl Rivers, to escort her son Edward to London with an armed escort of 2,000 men.
[286]However, upon reaching Northampton, Richard discovered that the king had already been sent onward toStony StratfordinBuckinghamshire.
[287]In response, and to forestall any Woodville family attempts on his person, on 30 April 1483, Richard had Earl Rivers, Edward's half-brotherRichard Grey, and Edward's chamberlainThomas Vaughanarrested and sent to the north.
[288]Richard and Edward journeyed to London together, where the young king took up residence at theTower of Londonon 19 May 1483, joined the following month by his younger brother,Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York.
[289]Despite his assurances to the contrary, Richard had Earl Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan beheaded in June 1483.
[290][291][292]Acting as Lord Protector, Richard repeatedly stalled the coronation of Edward V, despite the urging of the king's councillors, who wished to avoid another protectorate.
[293]That same month, Richard accused the Lord Chamberlain, theBaron Hastings, of treason, and had himexecuted without trialon 13 June.
[294]Hastings had been popular, and his death created considerable controversy, not least because his loyalty to Edward and his continued presence would have presented a major obstacle to Richard's path to securing the throne.
[295][296]A clergyman, likelyRobert Stillington, theBishop of Bath and Wells,[297]informed Richard that Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was invalid because of Edward's earlier union toEleanor Butler, thereby making Edward V and his siblings illegitimate heirs to the throne. On 22 June, the selected date for Edward's coronation,[298]a sermon was preached outsideSt. Paul's Cathedraldeclaring Richard the rightful king,[299]a post which the citizenry petitioned Richard to accept.
[300]Richard accepted four days later, and was crowned atWestminster Abbeyon 6 July 1483.
[301]Edward and his brother Richard of Shrewsbury, who were still in residence in theTower of London, hadcompletely disappearedby the summer of 1483.
[302]The fate of the two princes following their disappearance remains a mystery to this day, however, the most widely accepted explanation is that they were murdered on the orders of Richard III.
[303]Stripped of her family's influence at court, the widowedElizabeth Woodville, along with Richard's disaffected former ally theDuke of Buckingham, allied themselves withLady Margaret Beaufort,[5]who began to actively promote her son,Henry Tudor, a great-great-great-grandson ofEdward III[304]and the closest male heir of the Lancastrian claim,[m]as an alternative to Richard.
[305]Woodville proposed to strengthen Henry's claim by marrying him to her daughterElizabeth of York, the only living heir to Edward IV. Convinced of the need for Yorkist support, Henry promised his hand to Elizabeth well before his planned invasion of England,[306]a factor which caused many Yorkists to abandon Richard.
[307]By September 1483, a conspiracy against Richard began to be formulated among members of the disaffected English gentry, many of whom had been staunch supporters of Edward IV and his heirs.
[308]Buckingham's Rebellion[edit]Since Edward IV had regained the throne in 1471, Henry Tudor had lived in exile at the court ofFrancis II, Duke ofBrittany.
[309]Henry was half-guest half-prisoner, since Francis regarded Henry, his family, and his courtiers as valuable bargaining tools to barter for the aid of England, particularly in conflicts with France, and therefore shielded the exiled Lancastrians well, repeatedly refusing to surrender them.
[310]Henry, in particular, was supported by the Breton treasurerPierre Landais, who hoped that an overthrow of Richard would cement a joint Anglo-Breton alliance.
[311]Now in alliance with Richard's former supporter, theDuke of Buckingham, Francis provided Henry with 40,000 gold crowns, 15,000 troops, and a fleet of ships to invade England. However, Henry's forces were scattered by a storm, compelling Henry to abandon the invasion.
[312]Nevertheless, Buckingham had alreadylaunched a revoltagainst Richard on 18 October 1483 with the aim of installing Henry as king.
[313]Buckingham raised a substantial number of troops from his Welsh estates, and planned to join his brother theEarl of Devon.
[314]However, without Henry's troops, Richard easily defeated Buckingham's rebellion, and the defeated duke was captured, convicted of treason, and executed inSalisburyon 2 November 1483.
[315]Following the rebellion in January 1484, Richard stripped Elizabeth Woodville of all the lands bestowed upon her during her late husband's reign.
[316]For the sake of outward appearances, the two appeared to reconcile.
[317]Tudor conquest[edit]Following Buckingham's failed revolt, some 500 Englishmen fled toRennes, the capital ofBrittanyto join Henry in exile.
[318]Richard opened negotiations with Francis for Henry's extradition to England, however, the Duke continued to refuse, hoping for the possibility of extracting more generous concessions from Richard in exchange.
[319]By mid-1484, Francis was incapacitated from illness, leaving Landais to take the reins of government. Richard made overtures to Landais, offering military support to defend Brittany against a possible French attack; Landais agreed, however, Henry escaped to France by mere hours.
[320]Henry was warmly received at the court ofCharles VIII of France, who supplied Henry with resources for his coming invasion.
[321]Upon the recovery of Francis II, Charles offered the remaining Lancastrians in Brittany safe conduct to France, paying for their expenses himself. For Charles, Henry and his supporters were useful political pawns to ensure Richard did not intervene with French designs on the acquisition of Brittany.
[322]On 16 March 1485, Richard's wife,Anne Neville, died.
[323]Rumours quickly spread that she had been murdered to allow Richard to marry his niece,Elizabeth of York, rumours which alienated Richard's northern supporters.
[324]Richard's marriage to Elizabeth had the potential of unravelling the Tudor plans, and split the Yorkists who supported Henry from their cause.
[325]Henry secured the patronage of the French regentAnne of Beaujeu, who supplied him with 2,000 troops in support.
[326]Overseas, Henry relied heavily on his mother Margaret of Beaufort to raise troops and support for him in England.
[4]Anxious to press his claim, with the backing of the Woodvilles, Henry set sail from France on 1 August with a force consisting of his English and Welsh exiles, along with a large contingent of French and Scottish troops,[327]landing nearDale, Pembrokeshire, inWales.
[328]Henry's return to his Welsh homeland was regarded by some as the fulfilment of a Messianic prophecy,[329]as "the youth of Brittany defeating theSaxons" and restore their country to glory.
[330]Henry amassed an army of approximately 5,000 troops to confront Richard.
[331]Richard's lieutenant in Wales, Sir Walter Herbert, failed to move against Henry, and two of his officers deserted to the Tudor claimant with their troops.
[332]Richard's lieutenant in West Wales, Rhys ap Thomas, also defected.
[332]By mid-August, Henry crossed the English border, advancing onShrewsbury.
[333]Richard, who had been well-informed of Henry's movements, had ordered a mobilisation of his troops.
[334]The powerfulStanleyshad assembled their bannermen upon hearing of Henry's landing; while they had been communicating on friendly terms with Henry both prior to and during his landfall in England,[325][335]their forces were a wildcard, and would not support Henry until a decisive juncture in the coming battle.
[336]On 22 August 1485, Henry Tudor's outnumbered forces[337]engaged Richard's army in theBattle of Bosworth Field. Stanley's forces entered the fray on behalf of Henry, decisively defeating Richard's army.
[338]Polydore Vergil, Henry's official historian, records that "King Richard, alone, was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies",[339]and became the last English king to die in battle.
[340]Richard's ally theEarl of Northumberlandfled, while theDuke of Norfolkwas killed, and theEarl of Surreywas taken captive.
[336]Henry claimed the throne byright of conquest, retroactively dating his claim to the day prior to Richard's defeat.
[341]Henry was crowned asHenry VII of Englandon 30 October 1485 inWestminster Abbey.
[342]Challengers to Henry VII[edit]As per his pledge, Henry marriedElizabeth of Yorkon 18 January 1486,[343]and Elizabeth gave birth to their first child just 8 months later, Prince Arthur.
[344]The couple's marriage appears to have been a happy one;[345][346]Henry in particular was noted for being uncharacteristically faithful for a king of the time.
[344]Henry and Elizabeth's marriage united the rivalLancastrianandYorkistclaims since their children would inherit the claims of both dynasties; however, paranoia persisted that anyone with blood ties to the Plantagenets were secretly coveting the throne.
[347]Despite the union of the two dynasties, Henry's position as king was not immediately secure. That same year he faced arebellion of the Stafford brothers, aided and abetted byViscount Lovell, however the revolt collapsed without any open fighting.
[348]The Stafford brothers claimedsanctuaryat a church belonging to Abingdon Abbey inCulham,[349][350]however, Henry had the Staffords forcibly removed by the knightSir John Savage[351]on 14 May[349]and tried before theCourt of the King's Bench, which ruled that sanctuary was inapplicable in matters of treason.
[352]Protests over Henry's actions were lodged withPope Innocent VIII, which resulted in apapal bullwhich agreed to some modifications over the right of sanctuary.
[353]Henry also dealt with other potential threats to his reign; the heir to the Yorkist claimant was theEarl of Warwick, the ten-year-old son of Edward IV's brother, theDuke of Clarence.
[354]Henry had Warwick arrested and imprisoned at theTower of London.
[355]Lincoln's rebellion[edit]Around this time, a Yorkist-sympathising priest by the name of Richard Symonds had noticed a striking similarity between a young boy,Lambert Simnel, andRichard of Shrewsbury, one of thePrinces in the Tower, and began tutoring the boy in the manners of the royal court, perhaps hoping to put forth Simnel as an impostor Prince Richard.
[356]The rumour spread that Edward IV's children were still alive, however, the false report of the death of the imprisoned Earl of Warwick changed the impersonation, who was roughly the same age as Simnel.
[357]TheEarl of Lincoln, who himself had a claim on the throne as a Plantagenet descendant and Richard III's nephew,[354]left the royal court on 19 March 1487 forBurgundyto capitalise on the rumours.
[358]His aunt,Margaret, Duchess of Burgundyprovided him with financial and military support. The Yorkist exiles sailed forIreland, where the Yorkist cause was popular, to gather support.
[359]Simnel was proclaimed King Edward VI inDublindespite Henry's efforts to quell the rumours, which included parading the real Earl of Warwick through the streets of London.
[357]While nominally supporting the impostor king, Lincoln likely saw the whole affair as an opportunity to claim the throne for himself.
[360]Lincoln had no intention of remaining in Ireland, and with Simnel, 2,000Germanmercenaries and an additional large host of Irish troops, landed onPiel IslandinLancashireand proceeded to march on York.
[361]Though the Yorkist march avoided Henry's main army, they were repeatedly harassed by Tudor cavalry under Sir Edward Woodville.
[362]While Henry's army was outnumbered, they were far better equipped than the Yorkists, and Henry's two principal commanders,Jasper Tudorand theEarl of Oxford, were more experienced than any of the Yorkist leaders.
[363]The two armies met in battle atStoke Fieldon 16 June 1487, and resulted in the destruction of the Yorkist force.
[364]TheEarl of Lincolnwas killed in the fighting, while theViscount Lovelldisappeared, likely toScotland.
[365]Henry pardoned the young Simnel, likely recognising he was merely a puppet in the hands of adults, and put him to work in the royal kitchens as aspit-turner. Simnel later became afalconer, and died around 1534.
[366]Henry persuaded the Pope to excommunicate the Irish clergy who supported the revolt, and had Symonds imprisoned, but not executed.
[363]Stoke Field proved to be the last military engagement of the Wars of the Roses.
[367]Aftermath and Henry VII's reign (1487–1509)[edit]Warbeck's rebellion[edit]In 1491,Perkin Warbeck, a young man hired in the service of a Breton merchant,[368]was regarded favourably as an inheritor of the Yorkist claim to the throne by the pro-York citizens ofCorkinIreland, who allegedly decided to put Warbeck forth as an impostorRichard of Shrewsbury.
[369]Warbeck first claimed the throne at the Burgundian court in 1490, claiming to indeed be Richard, and that he had been spared due to his young age.
[370]He was publicly recognised as Richard byMargaret of York, sister of Edward IV, and was recognised as Richard IV of England at the funeral of theHoly Roman Emperor,Frederick III, and had become recognised as theDuke of Yorkin international diplomacy, despite Henry's protests.
[371]Some nobles in England were prepared to recognise Warbeck as Richard, includingSir Simon Montfort,Sir William Stanley,Sir Thomas Thwaites, and Sir Robert Clifford. Clifford, who visited Warbeck, wrote back to his allies in England confirming Warbeck's identity as the lost prince.
[372]In January 1495, Henry crushed the conspiracy with six of the conspirators imprisoned and fined, while Montfort, Stanley, and several others were executed.
[373]Warbeck courted the Scottish royal court, where he was well received byJames IV, who hoped to use Warbeck as leverage in international diplomacy.
[374]In September 1496, James invaded England with Warbeck, however the army was forced to withdraw when it expended its supplies, and support for Warbeck in the north failed to materialise.
[375]Having now fallen out of favour with James, Perkin sailed to Waterford.
[376]On 7 September 1497, Warbeck landed inCornwall, hoping to capitalise on theCornish people's resentment to Henry VII's unpopular taxes[377][378]which hadinduced them into revoltjust three months earlier.
[379]Warbeck's presencetriggered a second revolt; he was declared as Richard IV onBodmin Moor, and his army of 6,000 Cornishmen advanced onTaunton.
[379][380]However, when Warbeck received word the king's troops were in the area, he panicked and deserted his army. Warbeck was captured, imprisoned, and on 23 November 1499, he washanged.
[370]That same year, Henry had the captive Earl of Warwick, who had shared a cell with Warbeck and made an escape attempt together, executed. With Warwick's death, the directmale-linedescent of thePlantagenet dynastywas rendered extinct.
[381][382]Impact[edit]Immediate social effects[edit]Some historians question the impact the wars had on the fabric of English society and culture; revisionists, such as the Oxford historianK. B. McFarlane, suggests that the effects of the conflict were greatly exaggerated.
[383]Many parts of England were largely unaffected by the wars, particularlyEast Anglia.
[384]In the densely populated regions of the country, both factions had far more to lose by the ruin of the country through protractedsiegesandpillaging, and sought a quick resolution to the conflict through apitched battle; sieges that did occur, such as atHarlechandBamburghwere in comparatively remote and sparsely populated areas.
[385]Contemporaries such asPhilippe de Comminesobserved in 1470 that England was a unique case compared to wars that befell the continent, in that the consequences of war were only visited upon soldiers and nobles, not citizens and private property.
[386]Many areas undertook little effort to improve their defences; city walls were either left in prior ruinous states or only partially rebuilt, as was the case inLondon, whereby the citizenry was able to avoid devastation by persuading the Yorkist and Lancastrian troops to stay out, after the inability to reconstruct adequate walls, thereby rendering the city indefensible.
[387]Few noble houses were extinguished entirely by the wars; between 1425–1449, prior to the outbreak of fighting, there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes (25), as occurred between 1450–1474 (24), during the heaviest period of combat.
[388]However, several preeminent noble families had their power crippled because of the fighting, such as theNevillefamily,[266]while the direct male line of thePlantagenet dynastywas rendered extinct.
[381]Despite the relative paucity of violence undertaken against civilians, the wars claimed the lives of 105,000 people,[6]approximately 5.5% of the population level in 1450, though by 1490 England had experienced a 12.6% increase in population levels compared to 1450, despite the wars.
[389][390]Question of succession[edit]Although there would be no more serious military threat to Henry's rule or the Tudor claim to the throne that threatened a repeat of the Wars of the Roses, individuals claiming descent from the Plantagenets continued to present challenges to the Tudor dynasty; when Henry ascended the throne, there were eighteen Plantagenet descendants who may be considered to have a stronger claim to the throne, and by 1510 this number had increased by the birth of sixteen Yorkist children.
[391]The De La Pole family continued to lay claim to the throne; theDuke of Suffolk, brother of the executedEarl of Lincoln, was executed in 1513 byHenry VIIIfor this claim,[392]while his brotherRichard, known as theWhite Roseand who had conspired to invade England to claim the throne, waskilled in battleatPaviain 1525.
[393]As late as 1600 prior to the death ofElizabeth I, there were twelve competitors for succession,[394]which included seven Plantagenet descendants.
[395]TheTudor dynasty'stenuous claim to the throne and the potentially stronger claims of Plantagenet inheritors was a significant factor in driving Henry VIII's considerable anxiety over the need to produce a male heir.
[396]Henry was well aware of the potential instability that could follow a succession crisis, and wished to avoid a repeat of the Wars of the Roses.
[397]Tudor dynasty[edit]The English monarchy prior to the wars exerted only weak influence, unable to prevent the growing factional infighting that tore the political structure of the country apart.
[398]When Henry VII ascended the throne, he inherited a governmental structure that had been significantly weakened.
[399]Although the Tudor claim on the throne was weak and the new regime faced several rebellions, Henry's rule provided much-needed stability to the realm that prevented further outbreaks of civil war;[400]trade, commerce, and culture flourished, and England would not face civil war for155 years.
[1][2][401]Upon his death, Henry VII had left to his successors a prosperous, thriving economy, in part thanks to his frugal spending.
[402]Slavin (1964) considers Henry VII to be a member of the so-called "New Monarchs", defined as a ruler who centralised power in the monarchy and unified their nation.
[403]Though the monarchy saw a strengthening under the Tudors, Tudor monarchs generally operated within the pre-established legal and financial boundaries, which compelled the monarch to cooperate closely with the nobility, rather than against them.
[404]Nevertheless, Tudor monarchs, particularlyHenry VIII, defined the concept of the "divine right of kings" to help reinforce monarchical authority,[405]a philosophical concept which would come to plague England under the reign ofCharles I, leading toanother civil war.
[406]The ascension of the Tudor dynasty saw the end of themedieval period in Englandand the dawn of theEnglish Renaissance, an offshoot of theItalian Renaissance, that saw a revolution in art, literature, music, and architecture.
[407]TheEnglish Reformation, England's break with theRoman Catholic Church, occurred under the Tudors, which saw the establishment of theAnglican Church, and the rise ofProtestantismas England's dominant religious denomination.
[408]Henry VIII's need for a male heir, impelled by the potential for a crisis of succession that dominated the Wars of the Roses, was the prime motivator influencing his decision to separate England fromRome.
[409]The reign of Henry VIII's daughter,Elizabeth I, is considered by historians to be agolden agein English history, and is widely remembered today as theElizabethan era.
[410][411]HistorianJohn Guyargued that "England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors" than at any time since the Roman occupation.
[16]However, some historians such asKendall,Walpole, andBuckcontend that the characterisation of the Wars of the Roses as a period of bloodshed and lawlessness, contrasted with the Tudors ushering in a period of law, peace, and prosperity, served the political interests of the Tudors topresent the new regime positively.
[412][413][414]Indeed, contemporaries of the Tudors, such asWilliam Shakespeareand SirThomas More, wrote fictional and non-fictional works respectively which were hostile to the Yorkists.
[415][412]Armies and warfare[edit]Strategy[edit]Military strategy in themedieval periodwas predominated bysiege warfare; fortifications provided a powerful bastion of defence for a regional populace to shelter from large-scale pillaging that characterised groups such as theVikingsorMongols,[416]andcastlesevolved as a central point of control and protection for local elites to exercise their authority over a given area. Fortifications also nullified the dominant weapon of the medieval battlefield:heavy cavalry.
[417]Pitched battleswere generally rare compared to theClassical perioddue to a dramatic reduction in logistical capability,[418]and those that were fought tended to be decisive encounters that risked the deaths of the leaders and the potential destruction of the army as a fighting force, discouraging them from taking place.
[419]The Wars of the Roses were anomalous in this regard; nobles had a great deal to lose by the ruin of the countryside in a protracted conflict, so they tended to deliberately seek pitched battles to resolve their grievances quickly and decisively.
[385]Battlefield[edit]Decline of chivalry[edit]The code ofchivalrygoverned the actions of nobles in medieval warfare; in particular, nobles would often go to great lengths to take a fellow noble prisoner during combat in order toransomthem for a sum of money, rather than simply killing them.
[420]However, the concept of chivalry had been in decline for many years prior to the Wars of the Roses; for example, the battle atCrecyin 1346 (over a century prior) saw the cream of French nobility cut down by English archers,[421]and the killing of many wounded French knights by common soldiers.
[422][423]The Wars of the Roses continued this trend;Edward IVwas noted by contemporaryPhilippe de Comminesas ordering his troops to spare common soldiers and kill the nobles.
[386]Ensuring the deaths of nobles in battle often led to one side wielding lopsided political control in the aftermath as a result, as occurred afterTowtonat which 42 captured knights were executed,[424]andBarnet, which irrevocably broke the influence of the powerfulNevillefamily.
[266]Nobles who escaped battle may beattainted, thereby being stripped of their lands and titles, and would therefore be of no value to a captor.
[425]Tactics, arms, and equipment[edit]Much like theircampaigns in France, the Englishgentryfought on foot.
[426]Thoughheavy cavalryhad been the dominant class of soldier on the medieval battlefield for centuries,[427]the relative inexpensiveness to train and outfit an infantryman compared to an expensive mountedknightincentivised leaders for expanding their use,[428]and the late medieval battlefield saw an increased use of infantry and light cavalry.
[429]In particular, English armies were characterised by their use of massedlongbowmen, which often proved decisive in their encounters with French cavalry,[429]however, as the English nobility fought on foot, and due to advances in flutedplate armour, neither side possessed a decisive tactical advantage from the use of these archers.
[430]An exception to this was atTowton, where the Yorkist archers took advantage of the high winds to extend their maximum range, dealing disproportionate damage to their Lancastrian opponents.
[431][432]English armies of the time tended to favour a mix between infantry equipped withbillssupported by massedlongbowmen, a combination they would continue to use well into the Tudor period.
[433]Despite their frequent association with medieval warfare,swordswere rare among the common soldiery and were instead favoured bymen-at-armsorknightsas apersonal weaponindicating prestige and wealth.
[434]Other weapons commonly used by infantry and men-at-arms includeaxes,[435]halberds,[436]crossbows,[437]anddaggers.
[438]Hand cannonandarquebuseswere used by both sides, however their numbers were limited.
[439]While artillery was used as early as 1346 atCrecy, these were cruderibauldequinsfiring metal arrows or simplegrapeshot,[440]and were rendered obsolete by thebombardsthat came in the late 15th century.
[441]Bamburgh Castle, previously thought impregnable, was captured thanks to bombards in 1464.
[442]Field artillerywas used but sparingly;Northamptonwas the first battle on English soil to use artillery.
[443]Early cannon were expensive to cast as they were often made frombronze,[444]as such few commanders were willing to risk their capture on the field; atBarnetin 1471, the Yorkist artillery withheld their fire so as not to betray their location.
[445]The invention of theblast furnacein Sweden in the mid-14th century increased and improved iron production,[446]which led to advances inplate armourto protect soldiers from the powerfulcrossbows,longbows, and the advent ofgunpowderweaponry, such as thehand cannonand thearquebus, that began to emerge around the same time.
[447]By the 15th century, plate armour had become cheaper thanmail, although mail continued to be used to protect joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow, and groin.
[448]Contrary to the popular preconception of medieval armour as excessively heavy,[449]a full suit of medieval armour in the 15th century seldom weighed more than 15kg (33lbs),[450]substantially less than the loads that modern ground combat troops carry.
[451]Recruitment[edit]Following the climax of theHundred Years' War, large numbers of experienced unemployed soldiers returned to England seeking work in the growing forces of the local nobility. England drifted towards misrule and violence as feuds between powerful families, such as thePercy-Neville feudincreasingly relied on their retainers to settle disputes. It became common practice for local landowners to bind theirmesnieknights to their service with annual payments.
[452]Edward IIIhad developed a contractual system whereby the monarch entered into agreements namedindentureswith experienced captains who were obliged to provide an agreed-upon number of men, at established rates, for a given period. Knights, men-at-arms, and archers were often sub-contracted.
[452]Skilled archers could often command wages as high as knights.
[453]Thecomplex feudal structuresthat existed in England enabled nobles to raise largeretinues, with armies large enough that could challenge the power of the crown.
[33][35]Leadership[edit]As the wars were a series of sporadic battles fought across a period of over 32 years, many of the key commanders fluctuated due todeath in battle,death by natural causes,executions, and possibleassassinations. Some key commanders also defected between sides, such asWarwick the Kingmaker.
Yorkists are those who supported the rivalHouse of York's claims to the throne, over the incumbentLancastrian dynasty.
Lancastrians are those who supported the Lancastrian claim to the throne, principally by supporting the incumbent monarch,Henry VI.
Tudors are those who supportedHenry VII's claim to the throne by right of conquest in 1485.
[341]Yorkist rebels are Yorkists who, while not aligned with the claims of the Lancastrian dynasty, nevertheless rebelled against Edward IV during his reign.
