Message on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine - IASP

Message on the ongoing conflict in UkraineThe International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) is acutely aware and deeply concerned about the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine. This evolving humanitarian crisis has already resulted in significant loss of life, breaches of human rights and unwarranted attacks on civilians. The mass evacuation of millions of native individuals from Ukraine to foreign lands in search of safety and shelter has added to previous global record levels of internally displaced individuals, refugees, and asylum seekers who have and continue to escape conflict zones elsewhere in the world. The impact on the mental and physical health of displaced individuals will be immense, and all possible efforts to support all displaced individuals, refugees and asylum seekers need to be prioritised.
Experiences of war lead to high exposure to trauma, stress, loss and social upheaval. Such trauma has the potential to impact across a range of physical, cognitive, and emotional experiences associated with suicidal behaviour. The consequences of a conflict such as this will be felt for many years to come and often the impact on mental health remains hidden. As a result, it is vital that not only during the acute phase but also in the longer-term, the mental wellbeing of displaced and trauma-exposed individuals is supported through the provision of targeted psychosocial care, interventions, and informed treatment responses.
Through our specific projects, partners and our national representatives in the region and neighbouring countries, IASP continues to explore all avenues to ensure the provision of support to those affected by the crisis. It is important to acknowledge that while the current conflict has been unjustly targeted at one specific nation, the fallout is extremely wide reaching and has impacted individuals across the world. On a human level, we must look out for one another. A number of valuable and verified mental health and trauma related resources are accessible online and listed below.

#SuicidePrevention🧠 Depression can affect anyone. In 2019, 37 million people in th EU were diagnosed with chronic #depression (Source: Eurostat, 2021). To combat this, better public mental health care and less stigma around mental health are needed.

Thank you @IASPinfo President @suicideresearch#IASPGOLDCOAST2022Without culturally appropriate ax measures for young Aboriginal ppl, we’ll never be able to help. @MaddiOgradey from @blackdoginst not letting COVID get in the way of talking about this important work #IASPGOLDCOAST2022'They don't think it makes sense and is in a language that makes sense because we just don't have the tools available for them.' Maddison O'Grady-Lee from @blackdoginst spells out the reality for many First Nation young people who seek help. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Dr. Emmanuel Nii-Boye Quarshie @UnivofGh says that #decriminalization of suicide, data generation, awareness raising, capacity building, and advocacy are necessary in low- and middle-income countries to prevent suicide!#IASPGOLDCOAST2022Close to 10 % of countries have a stand alone National Suicide Prevention Stratgey. Emmanual Nii -Boye Quarshie highlighting where more needs to be done to prevent suicides in lower and middle income countries. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Media orgs: “Are you going beyond just safe language about suicide, & including representation of people with lived experience in media reporting about suicide, or guidelines for suicide prevention reporting, to reduce stigma and discrimination?” Stephen Scott #IASPGOLDCOAST2022‘Where are the opportunities for you to improve, expand and strengthen the meaningful involvement of people with lived experiences?’ Key questions to start our plenary sessions - thank you Stephen Scott @RosesInTheOcean #IASPGOLDCOAST2022The closing plenaries are about to conclude the final day of #IASPGOLDCOAST2022.

Chaired by @googarmstrong and @louiselasala!#IASPGOLDCOAST2022We need to require it, support it and fund it. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022 https://t.co/5buVpC7bfZThere have been some incredible examples demonstrating the value of inclusion of lived/living experience in everything we do in SP. Underlying all this work is the time, commitment, trust required. Orgs and funders have to take this time into consideration #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Post-conflict countries like Sri Lanka need to support women with better integration of domestic violence in mental health responses to tackle intimate partner violence. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022“Through mobilising an army of trained and supported people with a #livedexperience of suicide who provide connection, support & mutual understanding that comes from that lived experience.” - Sam Phipps, our Peer CARE Connect Coordinator speaks at #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Piumee Bandara highlights that 77% of suicides occur in lower and middle income countries and yet only 2% of research is focused here. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022The inimitable @DrSandersanOnie reflecting on suicide prevention in Indonesia and the complexity of religious beliefs and laws underpinning shame and stigma, fear and discrimination. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022Thrilled to be able to share some of the early work of my PhD looking to champion the voice of the lived experience survivor as we aim to improve our prevention efforts #IASPGOLDCOAST2022 https://t.co/EizqrxHcSMPoster on lived experience of suicide attempt by a specific method. #IASPGOLDCOAST2022The International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit charitable organization recognized by the IRS - Status EIN 20-4701041Join Our Mailing ListWe are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.
